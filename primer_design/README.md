# Primer design for Nanopore barcoding with dual-indexing layout

This R-Markdown script was used to design full-ITS primers with 9-bp sample tags.
The index sequences are taken from [Hawkins et al. (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1802640115),
and some filtering is done to remove primers with hairpin structure or a potential
for dimer formation.

- *reverse* (ITS4): XXXXXXXXXTCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC

A total of 15 primer plates were assembled.
