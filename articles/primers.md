# Primer design

For a fungal ITS barcoding project (ITS5-ITS4), 15 primer plates were
assembled using a dual-indexing strategy (see
[primer_design](https://github.com/markschl/DadaNanoBC/tree/main/primer_design))
and the corresponding [example
report](https://markschl.github.io/DadaNanoBC/articles/primer-design-example.md).

With the MinION, more plates could easily be pooled in one run ([Hebert
et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.1111/1755-0998.14028)).
